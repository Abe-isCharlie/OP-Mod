## OP Mod Changes

1. **V0.1:**
- Added Faster Conveyor. It's faster than titanium conveyor (but you unlock before titanium conveyor).
2. **V0.2**
- Added Big Kiln. It's a kiln, but bigger. Uses water to cooler more fast, generating more metaglass (i know, this don't make sense, just accept).
3. **V0.3:**
- Added Mini Drill. It's a small version of mechanical drill.
- Reworked on Fast Conveyor. Now is Surge Conveyor. Crafting just add 2 surge alloys.
4. **V0.3.1**
- Forget Surge Conveyor, we'll go back to Fast Conveyor.
5. **V0.3.4**
- Adjusting things.
